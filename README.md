## Usage

### Setup

To use this model, we assume you have performed feature extraction using the PyRadiomics Python library (<https://pyradiomics.readthedocs.io>). Note, that this study used PyRadiomics V.3.0.1. More information about the feature extraction can be found in the published manuscript cited below.

We provie the YAML configuration file (`PyRadiomics_config.yaml`) in this repository so that an identical feature extraction can be performed. See the PyRadiomics website for details on performing customized feature extractions (<https://pyradiomics.readthedocs.io>).

In addition to the radiomics features, the following nine patient-level features are required:

- `epi_age`: Patients age (years)
- `epi_female`: Binary variable for sex (0=Male, 1=Female)
- `epi_fhlc`: Binary variable for family history of lung cancer (0=No, 1=Yes)
- `epi_copdemph`: Binary variable for history of COPD or emphysema (0=No, 1=Yes)
- `epi_formersmk`: Former smoker status (0=No, 1=Yes)
- `epi_duration` Number of years smoked cigarettes
- `epi_cigday`: Cigarettes per day
- `epi_quittime`: Years since quitting for former smokers (Set to 0 for current smokers)
- `epi_bmi`: Body mass index (kg/m^2)

The data frame MUST also contain identifying variables for `study` (study ID), `pid` (patient ID), and `nid` (nodule ID), though these may be set to missing (`NA`) or use random values as these data are not used in the prediction but must be in the data frame for preprocessing.

Note: The data should NOT be normalized/standardized/scaled prior to using the `predict()` function described below. Normalization of predictors happens automatically during the call to `predict()`.

### Model Predictions

Once the feature extraction is complete, the code presented below can be used to load the model and make predictions on your data frame (or `tibble`), which is named `your_data` in the example below. 

As described in the previous section, the data frame for prediction must contain the three ID variables, nine patient variables, and the radiomics features. All other columns will be ignored. 

```r
# install.packages(c('parsnip', 'recipes', 'workflows', 'glmnet', 'vetiver'))
library(parsnip)
library(recipes)
library(workflows)
library(glmnet)
library(vetiver)

# Load the INTEGRAL-Radiomics model
integral_rad <- readRDS('INTEGRAL-Radiomics.rds')

# Predict probabilities for `your_data`
predict(integral_rad, new_data = your_data, type = 'prob')
```

The `predict(...)` function will return a data frame with two columns (`.pred_0` and `.pred_1`) that correspond to the probabilties of a pulmonary nodule being benign (`.pred_0`) or malignant (`.pred_1`). Users may wish to threshold these probabilities to obtain binary class labels.
